Variator by philipbenr

I was beginning to get vexed over the fact that Minetest blocks had no varitations, so I made this mod, which containes six different colored stone bricks with three (maybe I'll make four) different variations to each. There was probably a better way to program the hues, but I did it as quick, 10 minute project which I might expand on later. :)
